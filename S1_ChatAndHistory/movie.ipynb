      "\n",
      "'Sands of Time' is an epic adventure film that follows the journey of Jack Walker (Leonardo DiCaprio), a renowned archaeologist and time traveler, as he finds himself in ancient Egypt. Walker must navigate the treacherous landscape, decipher ancient mysteries, and confront powerful enemies as he attempts to uncover the secrets of a long-lost civilization. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Plot: \n",
      "\n",
      "The movie opens with a breathtaking aerial view of the vast Egyptian desert. We find Jack Walker and his team of archaeologists camping at the base of a towering pyramid. They have just discovered a long-forgotten tomb, and as they explore its depths, they stumble upon a mysterious artifact—an ancient hourglass filled with shimmering sand. \n",
      "\n",
      "Walker, fascinated by the artifact, realizes that it holds more than just historical value. Through his research, he discovers that the hourglass is a key to time travel, allowing its possessor to move between different eras. Intrigued, he decides to test its powers, and in a flash of light, he finds himself transported back in time to ancient Egypt. \n",
      "\n",
      "Walker materializes in a bustling marketplace, where he quickly attracts attention due to his modern attire. He soon encounters a beautiful and mysterious woman, Amara (played by Gal Gadot), who introduces herself as a priestess of the ancient goddess, Isis. Amara reveals that she has been expecting his arrival, for it was foretold in an ancient prophecy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Together, Walker and Amara embark on a perilous quest to unravel the secrets of the hourglass and discover its true purpose. Their path leads them across the desert, where they encounter deadly sandstorms, treacherous bandits, and mythical creatures of Egyptian folklore. Along the way, they form an unlikely alliance with a witty and cunning thief, Malik (played by Omar Sy), who possesses his own set of unique skills. \n",
      "\n",
      "As they journey closer to their goal, they uncover a sinister plot orchestrated by a power-hungry priest, Seth (played by Javier Bardem). Seth aims to use the hourglass to travel forward in time and conquer the future with ancient magic. To stop him, Walker, Amara, and Malik must navigate their way through treacherous traps and decipher ancient riddles hidden within the pyramids. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a climactic showdown, the trio confronts Seth at the top of a towering pyramid, where he prepares to perform a ritual to harness the hourglass's power. A fierce battle ensues, with Walker using his knowledge of modern combat and ancient Egyptian weaponry. Just as Seth is about to succeed, Walker shatters the hourglass, releasing its sands and causing a powerful time anomaly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The anomaly transports Walker and his allies back to the present, where they find themselves in a museum, surrounded by artifacts from their adventure. They realize that by breaking the hourglass, they have altered the course of history, ensuring that the secrets of time travel remain hidden. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Walker, now a legendary figure in the world of archaeology, imparts a final lesson to his students, emphasizing the importance of protecting the past and the power that lies within it. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Closing Scene: \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Our protagonist, Raj Malhotra (played by Amitabh Bachan), is a middle-aged Indian man with a weary look on his face. He walks with a slight limp, a reminder of past troubles. Raj is a former businessman who has fallen on hard times, having lost his fortune and reputation due to a scandal that ruined his life. \n",
      "\n",
      "As he makes his way through the busy streets, he passes by a group of wealthy socialites stepping out of a luxurious car. Their laughter and expensive clothing remind Raj of the life he once had. He feels a pang of bitterness and continues on his way. \n",

      "\n",
      "As he cooks, we see flashbacks of his previous life—the luxurious home, the expensive cars, and the adoring wife. It is clear that Raj is struggling to come to terms with his new reality. \n",
      "\n",
      "A knock on the door interrupts his thoughts. It is his neighbor, Maria (played by a supporting actress), an elderly woman who has taken Raj under her wing. She brings him a plate of homemade cookies and offers a friendly ear to listen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Raj confides in Maria, sharing his struggles with accepting his new life. He speaks of the shame he feels and the difficulty in letting go of the past. Maria, wise and compassionate, offers words of encouragement and a reminder that forgiveness, both of himself and others, is the path to healing. \n",

      "**Scene 3: The Search for Redemption**\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "As he works, he forms a bond with a young student named Ali (played by a child actor), who is struggling with his own personal demons. Ali is a troubled boy from a broken home, and he finds solace in Raj's kindness and wisdom. Their relationship develops, and Raj becomes a mentor and father figure to the boy. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Scene 4: Confronting the Past**\n",
      "\n",
      "News reaches Raj that one of the key players in the scandal that ruined his life is back in town. This man, Suresh (played by a supporting actor), was once Raj's business partner and best friend. Suresh had betrayed Raj's trust and fled the country, leaving Raj to take the fall. \n",
      "\n",
      "Determined to confront his past, Raj seeks out Suresh, leading him to a trendy nightclub owned by his former partner. Suresh, now a successful and influential man, is surprised to see Raj but offers a fake smile and a shallow apology. Raj, filled with anger and hurt, struggles to maintain his composure. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Scene 5: The Turning Point**\n",
      "\n",
      "The tension builds as Raj grapples with his desire for revenge. He considers taking drastic action, but the memory of Maria's words about forgiveness haunts him. Instead, he channels his energy into being there for Ali, who is facing a pivotal moment in his young life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ali, influenced by his turbulent home life, gets involved with a dangerous crowd and finds himself in a dire situation. Raj, sensing the boy's distress, intervenes and rescues Ali from a life of crime and destruction. This act of selflessness becomes Raj's turning point, as he realizes that his true redemption lies in helping others and being a force for good. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Scene 6: A New Beginning**\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passes, and we see Raj in a new light. He has embraced his life in New York, finding peace and purpose. His work at the school has made a profound impact, and he is beloved by the students and staff alike. \n",
      "\n",
      "The movie concludes with a heartwarming scene where Raj, now a respected member of the community, receives an award for his contributions to the school and the lives he has touched. As he accepts the award, he thanks Maria and Ali, who are in the audience, for their role in his transformation. \n",
      "\n",
      "The final shot is of Raj, standing on the streets of New York, looking up at the city skyline with a smile. He has found forgiveness, both for himself and for those who wronged him, and in doing so, he has discovered a new beginning in the unforgiving city. \n",
